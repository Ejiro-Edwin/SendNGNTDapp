# SendNGNT dApp

This dApp enables sending [NGNT](https://ngnt.org) from non-custodial wallets without ETH. It uses the Gas Station Network functionality of the NGNT token. Visit the app at [https://sendngnt.com](https://sendngnt.com).

### List of wallets currently supported:
  - Browser Injected wallets
  - Wallet Link (Coinbase Wallet)
  - Wallet Connect
  - Fortmatic
  - Portis
  - Torus

If you are using a wallet not yet supported, open an issue and we would work on getting it supported.

## Development

This project is built from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses Typescript.

The application requires a bunch of environment variables to be configured in order to
work properly. Check the `.env.sample` for a list of the configurable environment variable.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
